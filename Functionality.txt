This file tells functionality of add() method and all the other methods related to this method(). 

add()

-> Takes input question (string) from user
-> Gets index (int) from getIndex() method
-> Combines question and the index. Eg: 
      Input question:
             What is a Pointer?
      After combining index and question:
             1. What is a Pointer?  (If the index was initially 0). 
-> Adds this formatted question into the dataResource file. 
-> Increments the index in the index file, in other words, increases the count by one, because we just added a question. 


getIndex()

-> Opens the index file. 
-> Gets the Index as an integer. 
-> Returns this integer to the calling method. 

incrementIndex()

-> Opens the index file in ios::out || ios::trunc (write mode + truncate mode/replacement mode). 
-> Increments the index and puts it into the index file, thus replacing the previous index with the new and correct index.  

Happy Programming!!
