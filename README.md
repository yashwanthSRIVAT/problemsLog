# prohlemsLog
A logging application to store all the problems I solve on a daily basis.


   This Console-based application essentially saves all the coding questions/problems I solve regularly.
It has "dataResource" and "index" text files;

dataResource file has all the questions I save.
index file has the index of the latest question entered into the dataResource file.

Available operations in this application:

ADD- adds a question into the application.

SHOW- shows all the questions entered.

TOTAL- tells the count of questions stored in the application.

Advanced operation:

SEARCH: effectively searches for questions by text or by its index.

I don't hope to add the SEARCH functionality just yet.
